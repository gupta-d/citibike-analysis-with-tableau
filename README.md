<h3> <u>Introducing citibike</u></h3>

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 12,000 bikes and 750 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. It started in 2013 and has seen phenomenal growth ever since. 
Citi Bike provides all the historical data for this service.In addition citibike website also publishes monthly report and dashboards at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.

We intend to use tableau to analyze the citibike data during 2014-2018 period to answer a few questions as below:

1. What is the absolute and percentage <b>ridership growth</b> during 2014-18?

2. Is annual subscriptions share on the rise vs short term users (with 24 hours or 3-day passes)?

3. What are the <b>peak hours of usages</b> during <b>summer months</b> (May, Jun, July) and <b>winter months</b> (Dec, Jan, Feb)?

4. Which are the <b>top-10 and bottom-10 stations</b> by number of originating and terminating trips?

5. What are the <b>usage statistics by gender</b>? Do we see any impact of gender outreach programs?

6. What is the <b>average trip duration</b> as a function of rider’s age?

7. What is the <b>average trip distance</b> ?

8. Which bikes are most <b>likely due for repair/inspection</b> during the timespan?

9. How variable is the <b>bike utilization</b>?

10. Can we see <b>all bike stations on a geo-map</b> with their historical data?

11. How the <b>popularity of top-5 stations’ changes over the time span</b>

All the interactive charts are created using tableau public and the complete analysis report can be viewed as an interactive html page by followin the link: https://gupta-d.github.io/citibike-data_visualization-with-tableau/
